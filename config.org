Doom provides a lot of helpers out of the box, but here are some of my own. Feel free to tell me if there are any viable alternative built into Doom or Emacs.

* Projectile
I like how doom handles projects out of the box
#+begin_src elisp
(setq projectile-project-search-path '("~/code/"))
#+end_src
Unfortunately adding ~/.doom.d, ~/org and ~/roam to the search path did not work as expected. Therefore I have to add them manually.
* Org
** Better defaults
This makes it possible to use <s to insert a code block
#+begin_src elisp
(require 'org-tempo)
#+end_src
** Non-linear notetaking
The primary purpose of note-taking should not be for storing ideas, but for developing them. When we take notes, we should ask: â€œIn what context do I want to see this note again?" - somebody

I use org-roam to take notes in a graph(network). The way it works is that whenever you link to a note from another note an edge(connection) is created between the two. org-roam provides easy between nodes through their edges. This is useful because it allows me to build useful connections between my notes regardless of which topic(s) they belong to. I was inspired by the zettelkasten method although I don't strictly follow it.
#+begin_src elisp
(setq org-roam-directory "~/roam")
(setq org-roam-index-file "index.org")
#+end_src
[[file:roam_illustration.svg][An org-roam graph]]
** Linear notetakin
I also use org-mode for organizing knowledge that is more linear in nature. Among other things I manage todos, project ideas, quotes, reading lists, song lists, my calendar, gift ideas, wishlist and youtube scripts all in org-mode.

In addition to that i track my habits in org using org-habits.
#+begin_src elisp
(require 'org-habit)
#+end_src
* Competitive programming
I do competitive programming in cpp and for that I rely heavily on my snippets. All of them are hand written by me and only intended for my specific competitive programming workflow.
#+begin_src elisp
(set-file-template! 'c++-mode :trigger "template")
(setq yas--default-user-snippets-dir "~/.doom.d/snippets")
#+end_src

I use c++11 for all my competitive programming and that is all I use cpp for so always using c++11 linting is sufficient for me.
#+begin_src elisp
(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook (lambda () (setq flycheck-gcc-language-standard "c++11")))
(add-hook 'c++-mode-hook (lambda () (setq flycheck-clang-language-standard "c++11")))
#+end_src

I also use these functions for quickly compiling, running and testing cpp programs.
#+begin_src elisp
(defun comp-open-buffer (buffer &optional switch-window)
      (setq temp kill-buffer-query-functions)
      (setq kill-buffer-query-functions nil)
      (+popup/close-all)
      (+popup-buffer buffer)
      (setq kill-buffer-query-functions temp)
      (when switch-window (switch-to-buffer-other-window buffer))
      )

(defun comp-compile () (interactive)
       (setq temp compilation-read-command)
       (setq compilation-read-command nil)
       (comp-open-buffer (compile (concat "g++ \"" buffer-file-name "\" --std=c++11 -o /tmp/comp-a.out")))
       (setq compilation-read-command temp)
       )

(defun comp-run () (interactive)
       (comp-open-buffer (make-comint "comp-run" "/tmp/comp-a.out")) t)

(defun comp-test () (interactive)
       (setq buffer (current-buffer))
       (comp-open-buffer (make-comint "comp-test" "/tmp/comp-a.out") t)
       (setq y (clipboard-yank))
       (insert (if (eq y nil) "" y)
               (comint-send-input nil nil))
       (other-window)
       )

(map! :leader (:prefix ("k" . "competitive") :desc "Comp compile" "c" 'comp-compile))

#+end_src
* IRC
At the moment I only use circe for trigex's irc server. For freenode I use Matrix. I will probably move to using circe sooner or later once I get bouncing set up for that.
Inlining images plus 1000 line znc history lead to unbearable loading times. Therefore these are commented out.

I figured image in-lining is a bit... Dangerous.
#+begin_src elisp
;(require 'circe-display-images)
;(enable-circe-display-images)
#+end_src

#+begin_src elisp
(map! :leader (:prefix ("o" . "+open") :desc "Open circe" "i" '=irc))

                     :sasl-password (lambda (&rest _) (get-string-from "~/.freenode")) ; relax it's randomly generated, not used anywhere else and my disk is encrypted

#+end_src

* Web Browsing
I use xwidget-webkit which is a way of embedding a webkit browser inside of Emacs. I use xwidget-webkit whenever I am to open a webpage from within Emacs. For example if I am opening an link from my RSS feed or IRC which do inside of Emacs.
#+begin_src elisp
(defun olav-is-xwidget-webkit-buffer-p (buffer) (string-prefix-p "*xwidget webkit: " (buffer-name buffer)))

(defun olav-xwidget-webkit-buffer ()
  "xwidget-webkit buffer or nil if doesn't exist"
  (seq-find #'olav-is-xwidget-webkit-buffer-p (buffer-list)))

(defun olav-browse (&optional url second-argument)
  (interactive)
  (persp-switch "*BROWSER*")
  (if (called-interactively-p)
      (when (not (olav-xwidget-webkit-buffer)) (xwidget-webkit-browse-url "https://fossegr.im" nil))
    (xwidget-webkit-browse-url url nil))
    (switch-to-buffer (olav-xwidget-webkit-buffer)))
(setq browse-url-browser-function 'olav-browse)
(map! :leader (:prefix ("o" . "open") :desc "Open browser" "b"  'olav-browse))
#+end_src
* RSS
#+begin_src elisp

      '("http://fossegr.im/feed.xml"
        "https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=UCWQ1f0ZhD-qhJB3AfJEoW0w" ; My channel ? (haven't checked)

* Torrent
Yes.

Emacs has some torrent clients, but I couldn't get any of them to work very well.

#+begin_src elisp
;(defun olav-mentor ()

  ;)
#+end_src

* Media Viewers
Since I am inside Emacs all the time either way it makes sense to use it to open media files such as books and videos. I find Preview.app to work better than the Emacs pdf viewers so that is what I use to read books. Ideally I would want to open the media inside of xwidget-webkit, but I have not found a way to do this so far.
#+begin_src elisp
(defun olav-open-book ()
  (interactive)
  (setq temp default-directory)
  (cd "~/Google Drive/Books")
  (call-interactively 'counsel-find-file-extern)
;  (counsel-find-file-extern (+default/find-file-under-here))
  (setq default-directory temp)
)

(defun olav-open-anime ()
  (interactive)
  (setq temp default-directory)
  (cd "~/anime")
  (call-interactively 'counsel-find-file-extern)
  ;(counsel-find-file-extern (+default/find-file-under-here)
  (setq default-directory temp)
)

(map! :leader (:prefix ("o" . "open") :desc "Open a book" "B" 'olav-open-book))
(map! :leader (:prefix ("o" . "open") :desc "Open an anime episode" "A" 'olav-open-anime))
#+end_src
* Scratch Perspective
I use a scratch perspective to do tasks that don't fit in the current perspective or any other project. For instance if I am to install a global package when I am in the irc perspective I would switch to the scratch perspective an do it there. This serves as an alternative to pulling up an external terminal.
#+begin_src elisp
(defun olav-scratch ()
  (interactive)
  (if (+workspace-exists-p "*SCRATCH*")
      (persp-switch "*SCRATCH*")
      (progn (persp-switch "*SCRATCH*")
             (switch-to-buffer "*scratch*")))
)

(map! :leader (:prefix ("o" . "open") :desc "Open scratch" "s" 'olav-scratch))
#+end_src

* Other
I don't like, or understand for that matter the default behavior of `SPC w m m`. Therefore I rebound it to delete-other-windows which just works.
#+begin_src elisp
(map! :leader (:prefix ("w" . "window") (:prefix ("m" . "maximize") :desc "Actually maximize (as opposed to the default behaviour)" "m" 'delete-other-windows)))
#+end_src
I like relative line numbers
#+begin_src elisp
(setq doom-line-numbers-style 'relative)
#+end_src
